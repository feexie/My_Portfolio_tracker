# React + Vite

# My Portfolio Tracker

This project is a personal portfolio tracker built using **React** and **Vite**. It showcases my skills in frontend development and my ability to work with a variety of modern tools and technologies. The project is a part of my learning journey through the **ALX Software Engineering curriculum**, where I have developed a deep understanding of web development and software engineering principles.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to follow modular development practices, ensuring maintainability and scalability. It includes several components and sections, each responsible for a distinct part of the application.

src/ ├── assets/ # Static images and assets used in the app ├── common/ # Reusable components and context management (Theme, SkillList, ProjectCard) ├── sections/ # Application sections (Hero, Projects, Skills, Contact, Footer) ├── App.jsx # Main application component ├── main.jsx # ReactDOM root rendering with context provider └── styles/ # CSS files for styling the components and app.

## Tools and Technologies

### **Frontend**

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for modular, reusable code, making it ideal for large-scale applications.
- **Vite**: A blazing-fast build tool for modern web development. Vite enables fast local development and optimized builds for production.
- **CSS Modules**: Used for styling components with scoped and maintainable CSS.
- **ThemeContext**: Demonstrates context management in React to toggle between light and dark themes across the app.

### **Version Control**

- **Git & GitHub**: All project changes are version-controlled using Git, with commits pushed to a GitHub repository. The version control system enables collaboration, version tracking, and safe experimentation with new features.

### **ALX Software Engineering Tools and Skills**

As part of the specialization phase in the **ALX Software Engineering curriculum**, I have gained hands-on experience with the following tools and concepts:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Mastered these foundational technologies to build responsive and interactive web applications. Utilized HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.
  The core building blocks of web development, enabling me to create responsive and interactive web applications.
- **React**:Acquired advanced skills in developing single-page applications (SPAs) using React. This includes state management with React hooks, creating reusable components, and integrating with various APIs.
  Gained advanced knowledge in creating single-page applications (SPAs) using React, handling state management with hooks, and creating reusable components.
- Node.js: Gained experience in server-side JavaScript with Node.js, enabling server-side rendering, API development, and integration with frontend applications.

**ESLint:** Used ESLint to enforce consistent coding practices and maintain code quality, identifying and addressing potential issues in JavaScript code.

**Git:** Proficient in using Git for version control, including branch management, conflict resolution, and collaboration with other developers.

**Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design techniques to ensure applications are accessible and functional across diverse devices and screen sizes.

**Agile Methodologies:** Applied Agile practices such as Scrum and Kanban, facilitating iterative development, regular feedback, and effective project management.

**CI/CD Integration:** Developed a foundational understanding of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes to automate testing, integration, and deployment, improving development efficiency and project quality.

These skills and tools have been essential in developing modern, scalable, and maintainable solutions, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to frontend and backend development during this specialization phase.

- **Sequelize ORM**: Though not used in this frontend project, I am familiar with Sequelize for working with databases in backend development, particularly in handling data persistence and MySQL operations.
- **Express.js**: Experience with building RESTful APIs using Express.js for the backend, which powers the data flow between the frontend and the database in projects like my portfolio tracker.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes using the toggle button, managed by React's context API.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Project Showcase**: Displays a collection of my projects, each with a brief description and link to the source code or live demo.
- **Skills Section**: A list of the technical skills I have acquired, displayed with custom icons.
- **Contact Form**: A simple contact form allowing visitors to reach out to me via email.
